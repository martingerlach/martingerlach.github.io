I am co-organizing [Wiki Workshop 2025](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Workshop_2025), the largest Wikimedia research event of the year now in its 12th edition.  
The [call for papers](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Workshop_2025/Call_for_Papers) is out: Submit your 2-page extended abstracts by March 9, 2025. All submissions are non-archival, which means you can submit ongoing, completed, or already published works.
